## Introduction

Data structures are fundamental concepts in computer science that organize and store data efficiently, allowing for effective access and modification. This repository provides detailed explanations and code implementations for various types of data structures. 

It includes both **theoretical knowledge** and **code implementations** in various programming languages, such as Python, Java, C++, etc.
